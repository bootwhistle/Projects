<h1>Assignment 1</h1>
<p>By this time after taking the course for two weeks, you should have learned enough about React to create your first React App with a simple component.</p>
<h3>Learning Outcome</h3>
<ol>
<li>Build reusable components in React.</li>
</ol>
<section class="bvc-blue">
<h3 class="mt-3">Scenario</h3>
<p>You have joined a new team of developers that are currently working on building a simple weather and temperature app that can help the users to see latest weather updates. The requirements of the app will be as following:</p>
<ol>
<li>The application should display the current weather and temperature for a specific location.</li>
<li>The user should be able to search for a location and see the corresponding weather information.</li>
</ol>
</section>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<p>In order to complete the task, you will have to go through the following list of sub-tasks:</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the <a href="assignment-01.zip">provided stylesheets and JSON file</a> for this assignment.</li>
<li>Create an empty React application.</li>
<li>Create the proper folder structure and components required to build the final list component (i.e. /components/WeatherDisplay).</li>
<li>Write the components code that will first display a single static item.</li>
<li>Pass to the Weather App a static list of locations, provided in this assignment, from the root APP component and the component will dynamically loop over this list and display it on the home page.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Notes</h3>
<ul>
<li>Please use the stylesheets provided in this assignment for each component.</li>
<li>During this assignment the app will not be connected to an API for live date updates, and instead there will be a JSON data sample provided in a separate file to use as the data source.</li>
</ul>
